tcp 
client - i want to talk (syn)
server - let's talk (ack)
client - let's talk (ack + 1 )

but in Nmap --
nmap -sS 192.168.81.75/24   
(it will bypass old firewall)
client - i want to talk (syn)
server - let's talk (ack)
client - i do not want to talk (syn)

5. Repport
once anyone exploit the system - go ahead delete the file,  update the file, change 
the file anything
----------------------
recommendation - do not use common name as username and passwords.
and three attempt failure block the server.. 
---------------------
use all these things just formulate a report and provide to the business, I figure out so 
you should protect your system so that.

Ethical hacking across domains -
-  web application environment       or  web application domain
-  network architecture                       or network architecture
- mobile applications                           or mobile
etc. 
===========================================

two major categories :
- client side vulnerabilities 
- server side vulnerabilities

all the attacks can be categorized into 3 major attacks:

 - parameter Tempering  - MITM
-----
e.g.-
database server

application server
example.com
resp
"how are you today "
3241342342342342e423423h423424oi5252352o144

attacker - Man in middle - read, temper, change, delete  

3241342342342342e423423h423424oi5252352o144
"how are you today "
req
client 
-----
- unvalidated inputs   - xss, html injection 

web application 
example.com

login name:  admin  or attacker use java script  - <script>alert("you are hacked") </script>
or html injection - <iframe> src= "any malicious website link "</iframe>
or ' Union select * from users 

login password: admin 

-------------------------------------------------
Directory Transversal attacks  - OS command injection 

running a website related to DNS system --

DNSlookup

----------
===================================================
Web application domain: common attacks 
-------------------------------------------------------------
- Injection Flaws e.g. SQL injection, HTML  injection etc.
- Cross site scripting e.g. Reflected & Stored etc. 
- Web Services Attacks eg. DNS Cache Poisoning, File Uploads etc. 

-------------------------------------------------------------
login: <script>alert(document.cookie)</script>
Password: 

subscribe
email: <script>mail him some user information </script>

=====================================================
Web Application Domain : Hacking Methodology 

- web foot printing - gather information
- Vulnerability scanners - w3af, Acunetix 
- Identify Entry Points and attack surface 

--------------------------------------------------------------
-  web foot printing - gather information 

eg. 
login - admin
password - admin
in backend 
select  *  from users where login_name='admin'  AND password='admin'
-----------
or attack syntax - 
select * from users where user_id = 'blah' or 1=1--  and password= 'anything' 



a. run a happy cycle
b. try to read console and errors
c. try to read URL and cookies
d. read the page source 

--------------------------------------------------------
=================================================
=================================================
=================================================
=================================================
Mobile Application Domain------------

The mobile device has become an inseparable part of life today.
The attackers are easily able to compromise the mobile network 
because of various vulnerabilities, the majority of the attacks are 
because of the untrusted apps. The main operating system used are:

- Android
- IOS
- WINDOWS
- BLACKBERRY

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Mobile Application Domain : types of Android attacks 

Types of android attacks-----

- Untrusted APKs
- SMS
- Email
- Spying
- App Sandboxing Issues
- Rooting 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 click jacking - clicking on the link attacker link replaced from actual link.
Tap jacking - 
                    - Screen Overlay
                    - toast 
                     app - financial transaction 
                    pay - Transaction

Network Application Domain

Network Domain 

A network attack is an attempt to gain unauthorized
access to an organization's network, with the objective of 
stealing data or perform other malicious activity, There are 
two main types of network attacks:

- Passive : attackers gain access to a network and can monitor or 
steal sensitive information, but without making any changes to the 
data, leaving it intact.

- Active: Attackers not only gain unauthorized access but also modify data, either deleting, 
encrypting or otherwise naming it. 

--------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------
Types of Network attacks 
- endpoint attacks - gaining unauthorized access to user devices, server or other endpoints,
typically compromising them by infecting them with malware. 

- malware attacks - infecting IT resources with malware.  allowing attackers to 
compromise systems, steal data and do damage. These also include ransomware attacks.

- Vulnerabilities, exploits and attacks - exploiting vulnerabilities in software used in the 
organization, to gain unauthorized access compromise or sabotage systems. 
-vulnerable components - SSL 3.0 (HEARD PLEED ATTACK), DES (encryption), FTP, VSFTPD
------------------------------------------------

Advanced persistent threats - these are complex multilayered threats which include networks attacks but also other attack types. 

---------------------------------------------------
DDOS attack
multiple request are coming from different source to sever made down. 
UDP request .. 
memcached attack in GitHub

- Cloud Computing
- IOT -smart devices talking to each other
- Blockchain
- Edge Computing

Demonstration - SQL Injection 

a. run the happy cycle - like - unname - admin, Password- admin
b. see URL, Errors,  Console and Cookies. 
c. see page source 
       different files 
       scripts and css
       input tags 
try  SQL injection parameter like           ' "  ) }  -- ##      
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Generally query running behind - 
select * from users where login-'admin' and password='admin'
or
SQL injection parameter
select * from users where login= '' OR '1' = '1'  and password= '' OR '1' = '1' 
' OR '1' = '1                           -  its a true statement

 Web applications a Target -
- Easily available via the internet. (24/7)
- Mission - critical Business application with sensitive 
data - azure, outlook 
- Often direct access to backend data.
- Traditional firewalls and SSL provide no protection.
- Many application are custom- made == vulnerable.
