--------Describe the four types of security attacks ------------

interruption - attack  (DOS/DDOS) on availability so using firewall.
interception - attack  (MITM e.g., eavesdropping) on confidentiality so using encryption.
modification - attack  (MITM e.g., data tampering)  on integrity so using Hash.
fabrication - (Phishing/Impersonation (e.g., creating fake identities))attack on authentication so using digital signature, security education.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
===========================================================
===========================================================
------Explain the active and passive classification of security attacks------


-----------Passive and Active attack -------
---------------------
passive attack 
- obtain info that is being transmitted eaves dropping (silent)
- two types - a) release of message contents, b) Traffic analysis 
- very difficult to detect. 
-------------------Mitigation- -------------------
- use firewall, vulnerability assessment, network monitoring, encryption

-------------------
active attack 
---involved modification of the data stream or create of a false data stream or spread (fabrication) inject  on network (e.g. honeypot., data tampering) . 
--Masquerade (e.g. spoofing ) - one entity pretends to be a different entity.
--Replay (e.g. sniffing )- passive capture of a transaction and subsequent replay.
-- modification ( e.g.  IP Packet Checksum Field Updated  impact on Data Integrity Violation)- 
-- DOS - Stop access to resource.
-------------------Mitigation- -------------------
-- cryprographic Hash for integrity check e.g. SHA-256
-- implementing strict validation of checksums at every network node.
