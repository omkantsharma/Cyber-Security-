Hash functions are computational functions that determine a hash digest H from a given message M. They are also referred to as one-way functions
There are two types of hash functions we can use; one that uses a key which is called keyed hash function and another one which does not require a key which is the un-keyed hash function.
An unkeyed hash function is also called Modification Detection Code (MDE) while a keyed hash function is also known as Message Authentication Code (MAC)
Authentication is a process through which the identity of the sender of a message can be confirmed
SHA-512 and HMAC are types of one-way hash functions
Digital signature is the digital equivalent of handwritten signatures, where the signer uses his private key to sign. There are four types of digital signatures
Digital certificates require a Certification Authority (CA) whom every entity over a network can trust
Secure Socket Layer (SSL) was first used by Netscape to ensure data security sent through HTTP, LDAP or POP3.
One of the main objectives fo SSL is to ensure data integrity and privacy
Transport Layer Security (TLS) is an extension of SSL which aims to provide security and data integrity at the transport layer between two web applications.
