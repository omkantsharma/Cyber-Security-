Metasploit project is an open-source penetration testing platform that enables users to find and 
exploit vulnerabilities.

In 2003, HD Moore created Metasploit as a portable network tool. On October 21st,
2009, the Metasploit project was acquired by Rapid 7.

The Metasploit framework can be used to penetrate different operating systems like Windows XP, 
Windows 7, higher version of windows or other operating systems like Linux

Vulnerability is a weakness which can be exploited by an attacker to perform unauthorized 
action with the computer system. It can be as simple as a weak password or as complex as buffer overflow.

"exploit" is a piece of code, chunk of data or a sequence of commands that take the advantage 
of a vulnerability present in a computer system causing unintended behaviour to occur on a 
computer system such as giving unauthorized access to a system or allowing privilege escalation

The "payload" in Metasploit is the part of the private user text which could contain malware such 
as worm or viruses, which perform the milieus action deleting data,sending spam or encrypting data
