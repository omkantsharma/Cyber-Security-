CVSS & CVE

CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System):
--------------------------
-A framework used to assess and measure the severity of software vulnerabilities.

-Provides a numerical score (ranging from 0.0 to 10.0) that reflects the vulnerability's risk level.

- Scores are often represented in three severity levels:
Low (0.1–3.9)
Medium (4.0–6.9)
High (7.0–8.9)
Critical (9.0–10.0)
---------------------------
CVSS Metrics:

1. Base Metrics: Evaluate the fundamental attributes of a vulnerability.

-Attack Vector (AV): How the vulnerability is exploited (e.g., network, local).
-Attack Complexity (AC): The difficulty of exploitation (e.g., low, high).
-Privileges Required (PR): Level of permissions required.
-User Interaction (UI): Whether user involvement is needed.
-Confidentiality (C), Integrity (I), Availability (A): Impact levels.
-------------------------------------
2. Temporal Metrics: Adjust the score based on the current exploitability of the vulnerability.

3. Environmental Metrics: Customize the score based on the user's environment and assets.


Purpose of CVSS:
----------------------
-Standardizes vulnerability severity assessment.
-Helps prioritize remediation efforts.
-Used by security teams, vendors, and organizations.

CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures):
- A public database of known cybersecurity vulnerabilities.

- Each vulnerability is assigned a unique identifier (CVE ID) for easy reference.

CVE Format:
----
CVE-<Year>-<ID>
-----

- Example: CVE-2025-12345
             --Year: Year the vulnerability was added.
             --ID: Unique identifier for the vulnerability.

Key Features:
     1. Universal Identification: Provides a single, standardized name for a vulnerability.
     2. Collaboration: Enables easy sharing of information between vendors, security professionals, and tools.
     3.Database Sources: Managed by the MITRE Corporation and included in the National Vulnerability Database (NVD).

Relationship Between CVSS and CVE:
- CVE IDs are used to catalog vulnerabilities.
- CVSS scores provide the severity rating for CVE entries.
 - Example: A CVE entry like CVE-2025-12345 will include its CVSS score and vector details,       such as:
-----------------------
CVE-2025-12345
CVSS Score: 8.2 (High)
Vector: AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N
-------------------------
Use in Security:
------------
- CVE identifies the vulnerability.
- CVSS quantifies its severity to help prioritize actions.
Both CVE and CVSS are critical tools for vulnerability management and cybersecurity strategies.
