================================================

To determine the distance vector using hop count in a network, you can use the traceroute command. The hop count represents the number of intermediate devices (like routers) that a packet passes through to reach its destination.

Steps to Use traceroute Command:
Open Command Line Interface:

On Windows, open Command Prompt.
On Linux/macOS, open the Terminal.
Run the traceroute Command:

On Windows:
php
Copy code
tracert <destination>
Example: tracert google.com
On Linux/macOS:
php
Copy code
traceroute <destination>
Example: traceroute google.com
Interpret the Results:

Each line in the output represents a hop (router) on the path to the destination.
The hop count is the number of rows before the destination is reached.
If there is a * or timeout in a row, it means the hop did not respond.
Example Output:
For tracert google.com:

Copy code
1   192.168.1.1      <1 ms   <1 ms   <1 ms
2   10.0.0.1         5 ms    5 ms    5 ms
3   203.0.113.1      20 ms   20 ms   20 ms
4   8.8.8.8          30 ms   30 ms   30 ms
In this case:

The hop count to the destination (8.8.8.8) is 4.
This helps measure the number of hops and network latency between the source and the destination.
